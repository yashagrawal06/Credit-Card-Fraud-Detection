# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Approach:

1) Data Preprocessing: performed data cleaning, feature scaling, normalizing.
Used Synthetic minority over-sampling technique(SMOTE) to handle the problem of imbalanced dataset.

2) Model Building: Built Logistic regression classifier to determine fraudulent and geniune transactions.

3) Evaluating model accuracy: Used confusion matrix and metrics like Recall, F-1 Score and precision.

Next Steps-
1) Run recursive feature elimination (RFE) to determine best features to be used in the model.
2) Compare Logistic classifier with Random Forest classifier.
